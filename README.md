# Music-Theory-Quiz

## Description

In this project I was tasked with building a short quiz (I chose music theory as the subject matter) that was timed and for which the user would receive negative seconds on the clock when a wrong answer was selected. Following the completion of the quiz the user was presented with their finish time and invited to enter their initials. Initials and score were logged in local storage and presented on a separate high score page. Users could navigate to the high score page to view the scores or clear them.

The primary problems that I solved in creating this quiz where the implementation of browser APIs to dynamically update html and styles. I also worked to include event listening as well as timing features.

The following image is a screen shot from a question in the quiz:
